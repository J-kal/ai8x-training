# Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) Policy for Pose Estimation
#
# This policy defines when to start QAT and what bit width to use.
# QAT is essential for deployment on MAX78000/MAX78002.
#
# The start_epoch should be after the model has converged with
# knowledge distillation to avoid instability.
